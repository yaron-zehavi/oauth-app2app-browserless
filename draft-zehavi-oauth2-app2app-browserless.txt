             draft-zehavi-oauth2-app2app-browserless-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol enabling native apps from different
   app publishers, using the App2App pattern to act as OAuth Client And
   Authorization Server, native browserless user navigation.

   The native experience is retained also when the Client uses any
   number of brokers to federate across trust networks, while retaining
   highest levels of security.

1.  Introduction

   This document, OAuth 2.0 App2App Browserless Flow (Native App2App),
   discusses applications from different issuers that act as OAuth 2.0
   Client and Authorization Server, following the [App2App] pattern, to
   achieve native authentication and authorization.

   This specification addresses the challenge arising when a Client App
   reaches the User-Authenticating Authorization Server's app through
   one or more brokering Authorization Servers.

   Since OAuth Brokers's urls are not owned by any apps as deep links,
   App2App flows through brokers require using a web browser, which
   degrades the user experience.

   This document presents a protocol enabling native App2App browser-
   less navigation, through any number of brokers, without compromising
   on any security property.

1.1.  Difference from [OpenID.Native-SSO]

   [OpenID.Native-SSO] also offers a native SSO flow across applications
   without requiring the browser.  However, it is dealing with the
   specific sub-case when both apps are published by the same issuer and
   leverage this fact to share information.

1.2.  Terminology

   In addition to the terms defined in referenced specifications, this
   document uses the following terms:

   "OAuth":  In this document, "OAuth" refers to OAuth 2.0, [RFC6749]
      and [RFC6750] as well as [OpenID] referring to their
      *authorization code flow*.

   For consistency and readability, it shall use OAuth terminology -
   *Client* and *Authorization Server*, equally interchangeable with
   OpenID Connect *Relying Party* and *OpenID Provider* when OpenID
   Connect is used.

   "PKCE":  Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) [RFC7636], a mechanism to
      prevent various attacks on OAuth authorization codes.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.2.  OAuth Broker

   A component acting as an Authorization Server for its clients, as
   well as an OAuth Client towards downstream Authorization Servers.

   Brokers are used to facilitate a trust relationship when there is no
   direct relation between an OAuth Client and the Authorization Server
   where the end-user authenticates and authorizes.

   Brokers are used in federation use cases, such as in Academia and in
   the business world connecting across subsidiaries or B2B
   relationships across corporations.

   Facilitation of trust across OAuth Clients and Authorization servers
   not directly connected may be solved in the future with
   [OpenID.Federation], Brokers have been long used as an established
   pattern to bridge trust networks.

3.3.  App2App with brokers requires a web browser

   Since OAuth Brokers reside on web domains which no native app claims
   as Deep Links, OAuth requests to Brokers and responses to Broker's
   redirect_uri will be handled by a web browser.

3.4.  Impact of using a web browser

   Using a web browser downgrades the user experience in several ways.
   The browser may be noticed by end-user as it is loading urls and
   redirecting to native apps.

   The browser may prompt end-user for consent before opening deep
   links, introducing additional friction.

   App developers have limited control as to which browser will be
   opened on the return redirect to the Broker, so any cookies used to
   bind session identifiers (nonce, state or PKCE verifier) to the user
   agent may be lost, causing the flow to break.

   Finally, the browser may be left after the flow ends with "orphan"
   browser tabs used for redirection.  While these do not impact the
   process directly, they can be seen as clutter which degrades the
   overall UX's cleanliness.

4.  App2Web

   Whenever the user's device has no app owning the User-Authenticating
   Authorization Server's urls as deep links, the flow requires the help
   of a browser.

   This is the case when the User-Authenticating Authorization Server
   offers no native app, or when such an app exists but is not installed
   on the end-user's device.

   This is similar to the flow described in [RFC8252], and referred to
   in [App2App] as *App2Web*.

5.  Browser-less App2App with Broker

5.1.  Flow Diagram

5.2.  Components

5.2.1.  Client App

   Native app acting as OAuth client of Primary Broker.  Client's
   redirect_uri is claimed as a deep link of Client App.

5.2.2.  Client App's Primary Broker

   An OAuth Broker:

   *  Serving as Authorization Server for Client App

   *  An OAuth client of one or more downstream authorization servers

   The Primary Broker performs additional handling for browser-less
   App2App use-case, covered in Section 5.3.

5.2.3.  Downstream Authorization Server

   An Authorization Server which may be a:

5.2.3.1.  Secondary Broker

   Additional brokers may be engaged in redirecting the flow, serving
   upstream brokers as OAuth clients.

   They do not perform user authentication and authorization.

5.2.3.2.  User-Interacting Authorization Server

   The Authorization Server which interacts with end-user to perform
   authentication and authorization.

   May or may not offer App2App via a native app claiming it's urls as
   deep links.  Such app may or may not be installed on end-user's
   device.

5.3.  Protocol flow

5.3.1.  Client App calls Primary Broker

   Client App calls Primary Broker's authorization_endpoint to initiate
   an authorization code flow, indicating App2App flow by use of a
   dedicated scope such as app2app.

   Client App's redirect_uri is claimed as a deep link and will be
   referred to as _client_app_deep_link_.

5.3.2.  Primary Broker returns authorization request to Downstream
        Authorization Server

   Primary Broker validates Client's request and prepares an
   authorization request to Downstream Authorization Server's
   authorization_endpoint.

   Primary Broker provides _client_app_deep_link_ to Downstream
   Authorization Server in the dedicated structured scope:
   app2app:*client_app_deep_link*.

   Primary Broker responds with HTTP 302 and the authorization request
   url towards Downstream Authorization Server in the Location header.

5.3.3.  Client App traverses Brokers with request

   Client App uses OS mechanisms to detect if the authorization request
   URL it received is handled by an app installed on the device.

   If so, Client App natively invokes the app to process the
   authorization request, achieving from the user's perspective native
   navigation across applications.

   If an app handling the authorization request URL is not found, Client
   App natively calls the authorization request URL using HTTP GET and
   processes the response:

   *  If the response is successful (HTTP Code 2xx), it is probably the
      User-Interacting Authorization Server.  This means the Client App
      "over-stepped" and needs to downgrade to App2Web.

   *  If the response is a redirect instruction (HTTP Code 3xx +
      Location header), a Secondary Broker was reached and Client App
      repeats the logic previously described:

      -  Check if an app owns the obtained url, and if so natively
         invoke it.

      -  Otherwise natively call the obtained url and analyze the
         response.

   *  Handles error response (HTTP 4xx / 5xx) for example by displaying
      the error.

   As the Client App traverses through Brokers, it maintains a list of
   all the domains it traverses, which shall serve as the Allowlist when
   later traversing the response.

5.3.3.1.  Secondary Brokers

   Secondary Brokers engaged in the journey need to retain structured
   scope app2app:*client_app_deep_link* in downstream authorization
   requests they create.

5.3.3.2.  Note - Downgrade to App2Web

   If Client App reaches a User-Interacting Authorization Server with no
   app handling its urls, it may not be possible to relaunch the last
   authorization request URL on the browser as it might have included a
   single use request_uri which by now has been used and is therefore
   invalid.

   In such a case the Client App needs to start over, generating a new
   authorization request without App2App indication.

   This request is then launched on the browser.

   The remaining flow follows [RFC8252] and is therefore not further
   elaborated in this document.

5.3.4.  Processing by User-Interacting Authorization Server

   The User-Interacting Authorization Server processes the authorization
   request using its native app:

   *  Native app displays the UI for user authentication and
      authorization.

   *  The _client_app_deep_link_ provided in the strcutured scope,
      overrides the request's original redirect_uri:

      -  User-Interacting Authorization Server's native app validates
         that an app owning _client_app_deep_link_ is on the device

      -  If so it natively invokes it, handing it the redirect url with
         its response parameter

      -  If such an app does not exist it is an error and the flow
         terminates

   *  To establish trust towards client_app_deep_link, User-Interacting
      Authorization Server shall use OpenID Federation:

      -  Strips url path from _client_app_deep_link_ (retaining the
         domain).

      -  Adds /.well-known/openid-federation and performs trust chain
         resolution.

      -  Inspects Client's metadata for redirect_uri's and validates
         _client_app_deep_link_ is included.

5.3.5.  Client App traverses Brokers in reverse order

   Client App is invoked by User-Interacting Authorization Server App
   with a url as parameter which is the request's redirect_uri.

   Client App validates this url, and any url later obtained as a 3xx
   redirect instruction from the brokers it traverses, against the
   Allowlist it previously generated and fails if any url is not
   included in the Allowlist.

   Client App invokes the url it received using HTTP GET:

   *  If the response is a redirect instruction (HTTP Code 3xx +
      Location header), Client App repeats the logic and proceeds to
      call obtained urls until reaching its own redirect_uri
      (_client_app_deep_link_).

   *  Otherwise (HTTP Code 2xx / 4xx / 5xx) is a failure.

5.3.6.  Client App obtains response

   Once Client App's own redirect_uri is obtained in a redirect 3xx
   directive, Client App proceeds according to OAuth to exchange code
   for tokens or handle error responses.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  OAuth request forgery and manipulation

   It is recommended Client App shall be a confidential OAuth client.

6.2.  Secure Native application communication

   If Client App uses a Backend it is recommended to communicate with it
   securely:

   *  Use TLS recommended version and ciphers.

   *  Use DNSSEC.

   *  Perform certificate pinning.

6.3.  Deep link hijacking

   It is recommended that all apps in this specification shall protect
   their deep links using Android universal links / iOS App Links
   including the most specific package identifiers to prevent deep link
   hijacking by malicious apps.

6.4.  Open redirection

   Client App constructs an Allowlist of domains it traverses through
   while processing the request, for enforcing urls it shall later
   traverse through during response processing.  This serves to mitigate
   open redirection attacks as urls outside of this Allowlist will be
   rejected.

   In addition Client App should ignore any invocation for response
   processing which is not in the context of a request it initiated.
   One way to achieve this is by treating the Allowlist as a single-use
   object and destruct it after each protocol flow ends.

   Client App should allow only one OAuth request processing at a time.

6.5.  Authorization code theft and injection

   It is recommended that PKCE is used and that the code_verifier is
   tied to the Client App instance.

6.6.  Handling of Cookies

   Client App acts in this specification as a user agent compatible with
   a browser in respect to handling redirects.

   It can be expected that some Authorization Servers will use Cookies
   to bind security elements (state, nonce, PKCE) to the user agent.

   To support these security measures and prevent breaking the flow,
   Client App should act like a browser with regards to Cookies, namely:

   *  Store cookies it obtains on HTTP responses.

   *  Send cookies on subsequent HTTP requests to servers that returned
      cookies.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
